      <strong>POLITICS:</strong>
      <p>
      Politics is something that I find very important. I’m a patriot who only wants the best for her country. Basically there are two parties (three if you count independent). There is the republican party, also known as conservatives for right wing, and there is the democartic party, also known as liberals and left wing. Republicans are known for supporting free market capitalism, free enterprise, business, strong national defense, social-conservative policies, and traditional values. I don’t necessarily agree with all their ideologies, but I do agree with a lot of it. The democratic party fear that corporations have too much control over our government. Many are pro socialism and are known for being more lenient compared to republicans. They also advocate for equal rights no matter the gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. I’d like to think that many republicans do that too.

  I advocate for equality and end to hatred. My entire life I heard and met people that suffered and had to face prosecution just because of their ethnicity. I come from a very Jewish household and was raised with Jewish values. Ever since a child I listened to the stories of holocaust survivors. Read and learned about anti-semetism and how Jews are always targeted. In 2018, there was a shooting in a synagogue and the reason was because they were Jewish. I do understand what hate does. That’s why I want to end it and spread awareness. The problem is that many people associate hate with republicans. They believe that they are racist, and hate everyone but their kind. That’s not the case. I mean there are those who are racist but not everyone is like that. When I say I’m republican people assume I’m a white nationalist which is so not true. Anyway I’m a republican who advocates for the rights and capitalism.

  <strong>Some facts about me:</strong>
    I am a girl from Queens, New York. I’m a rising senior, and I am really nervous about college and the application process. I live at home with my mom, my dad, and my brother lives in Arizona. When I'm not at girls who code, you can find me watching Netflix with friends or by myself.
